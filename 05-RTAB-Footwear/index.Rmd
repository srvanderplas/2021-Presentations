# Project Status

---
class: primary-cyan
## Active: May - October 2020

- Work focused on the scanner internals, which are common to both the indoor (CSAFE-funded) and outdoor (NIJ funded) scanner

  - NIJ Award from 2019 had to be transferred to UNL
  - Engineering support essential over summer 2020 to get the project up and going

- once NIJ award was transferred, CSAFE project was paused

- Project is expected to resume in March 2022 when the NIJ grant ends.
