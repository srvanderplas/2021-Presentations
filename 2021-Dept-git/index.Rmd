## Why version control?

.center[![:scale 50%](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif)]


---
## Why version control?

- Log what you changed along with the state of your code/paper
    - keep a working version and experiment with changes

- Share your work 
    - [Paper preprints](https://github.com/srvanderplas/AnnualReviewStatisticsVisualization/blob/master/Visualization.pdf), corresponding code and data...
    - Host [package documentation](https://srvanderplas.github.io/ImageAlignR/index.html)
    - Host a [personal website](https://srvanderplas.netlify.app/)

- Collaborate - individuals work independently, git handles merging versions

- Report bugs and propose bug fixes for other projects

## How it works (conceptually)

.center[![](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/play-changes.svg)]

We're all familiar with track changes in word processing software

.bottom[Image from Software Carpentry's [git lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/01-basics/index.html)]

Separate changes applied to the original document = two different end results

???

If changes are separate from the document itself, you can think about "playing back" different sets of changes on the base document, with the end result of different versions of that document.

This allows multiple users to change the same document and merge changes

???

You can even think about multiple users changing the same document - as long as they don't change the same part of the document, you can merge the changes easily. If they change the same section of the document, there is a merge conflict that you have to manually resolve (but hopefully that conflict is limited to a small section of the document).

If you store the changes separately from the original document.... it's like an infinite multi-user "undo" button

## Introduce yourself to git

In the shell, tell `git` who you are and what your email address is:

```
git config --global user.name 'Jane Doe'
git config --global user.email 'jane@example.com'
git config --global --list
```

OR, use the `usethis` package to do this for you

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Jane Doe", 
               user.email = "jane@example.com")
```

.emph.cerulean.center[Use the email address associated with your GitHub account!]

---
## How does it work?

- Each project/paper is a repository

- git works off of a `.git` folder in the repository
    - index of files tracked
    - configuration files
    - other arcane stuff
    
- You tell git what to track with `git add <file>`

- You tell git what changes to record with `git stage`

- You summarize the staged changes with `git commit`

- `git` handles keeping track of the index, versions, changes, etc.

.center.emph.cerulean[So far, we've just talked about `git` on your local machine]

---
## How it works

![git add diagram: add tels git to add the file to the index of files git is monitoring](https://srvanderplas.github.io/unl-stat850/image/git-add.png)

git add tells git to monitor changes to a file (and "stages" the original version)

---
## How it works

![git commit the changed line](https://srvanderplas.github.io/unl-stat850/image/git-commit.png)

git commit records a change or set of changes to a file.


git commit works best with small, local changes that form a cohesive unit - so e.g. "Fixed feature XYZ in function ABC"

---
##  How it works: Git and GitHub

.pull-left[
![GitHub workflow](https://srvanderplas.github.io/unl-stat850/image/git_push_diagram.png)].pull-right[
![](https://srvanderplas.github.io/unl-stat850/image/git_pull_diagram.png)
]

???


- `git` runs on your local machine

- GitHub runs in the cloud

- `git push` tells GitHub to update the cloud version to what is on your local machine

- `git pull` tells your local machine to update its version based on what's on GitHub


---
## Workflow

In general, your work flow will be

1. Clone or "fork" an existing project or create a new repository

2. Make some changes

3. Stage the changes with git add

4. Commit the changes with git commit

5. .cerulean[Pull any changes from the remote repository]

6. .cerulean[Resolve any merge conflicts]

7. Push the changes (and merged files) with git push

.emph.center.cerulean[These steps aren't necessary if you're working alone on a single machine]

Note: if using the shell, you may also need a bit of help with the text editor. See [SWCarpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/index.html) for more details

## Authentication

Options: HTTPS and SSH

- HTTPS:     
credentials cached with your operating system's credential manager    
[Instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html) 

```{r, eval =F}
install.packages(c("usethis", "gitcreds"))

usethis::create_github_token()
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```


- SSH:     
set up a SSH key (or use one already there) and add the key to git    
[Instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#ssh-keys-1)

## Try it out

1. Create a new repository on github and include a README (so that you can pull the repository down)

    - go to https://github.com/<your username>, Click the plus sign in the top right corner
    - give your repository a name
    - check the Add a README file box

2. Click the green CODE button and copy the HTTPS or SSH address

3. Use the shell to `git clone` your repository

4. On your machine, edit the README to say "This is my test repository". Save, add, and commit your change using the shell

5. Push your change to the GitHub repository. Did it update?

## Using git within RStudio

- 2 options for creating projects: Local first, or Remote first

- Remote first:
  - Create the repository on GitHub and clone to your machine using RStudio
  - Add any "starter files" AFTER you clone
  - Create the repository with a README file
  
- Local first:
  - Create a RStudio project on your local machine and tick the "Create a git repository" box
  - Add any "starter files" and commit with git
  - Create a blank repo on GitHub (NO README!)
  - Follow GitHub's instructions for adding a remote

---
## RStudio git integration

![](rstudio-git-tab.png)

- Diff button
- Commit button
- Pull button
- Push button
- History button
- Settings
- Repository/branch
- Refresh

---
## RStudio - Diff button

![](rstudio-diff-btn.png)

---
## RStudio commit button

![](rstudio-commit-btn.png)

???

You can push and pull from this interface directly, or use the smaller buttons in the git tab to do the same thing

---
## Rstudio git integration

![](rstudio-history-btn2.png)

???

The history tab lets you see what got added and removed when, and by whom (if you're working with multiple people). It's incredibly useful if you're working with a group, or on a project that has lots of moving parts. 

You can also identify merges and conflicting branches -- this is helpful for figuring out where something went wrong (if it did). Or just for mocking collaborators who didn't pull before they started working.

## Try it out (Rstudio)

1. Create a new repository on github and include a README (so that you can pull the repository down)

    - go to https://github.com/<your username>, Click the plus sign in the top right corner
    - give your repository a name
    - check the Add a README file box

2. Click the green CODE button and copy the HTTPS or SSH address

3. Create a new RStudio project using version control, and paste the repository address into the URL box

4. On your machine, edit the README to say "This is my test repository". Save, add, and commit your change using RStudio's interface

5. Push your change to the GitHub repository. Did it update?

## What if I run into trouble?

.center[![:scale 50%](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)]


---
## Things to avoid

- Nested folders with git repositories

- Files over 50 MB (if you use GitHub)

- Having git track files that are generated from other files (plots, PDFs, etc.)
    - unless you need to store them on github/make them available (e.g. final versions of papers)

- Don't add anything to a public GitHub repository you don't want to be public
    - copyrighted material (papers, etc)
    - passwords
    - student information
    
- Only commit files that you changed yourself!
    - avoid adding .DS_Store, .directory, etc. to git

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
usethis::git_vaccinate() 
# ignores common nuisance files at the user level
```
    

---
## What about git's other features?

- Branching
    - useful for projects where you have a working "release" copy and are also actively developing new features
    - can also be used to host documentation, etc. on GitHub
    
    
- [Collaboration](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/08-collab/index.html)
    - Add other users to your remote repository on GitHub
    - Always pull before you start working (and frequently during work)
    - Commit and push frequently! (smaller merge conflicts)
    
- [Ignore files](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/06-ignore/index.html)
    - File named .gitignore in each sub-directory
    - Add file names (or e.g. *.docx) to ignore 
    - good for large files, sensitive data, etc.
